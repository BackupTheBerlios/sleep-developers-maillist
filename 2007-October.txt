Hello everyone,
Sleep 2.1-b19 has been released.  Here is a summary of the changes:

- Added callcc to Sleep

This was an extension of the current yield mechanism already in place. 
callcc enables the current function to call another one with the paused 
state (ala yield) of the current function passed to the next one as a 
parameter.  Some think of this as a functional goto.

- Added inline functions

inline functions are the closest thing Sleep has to macros.  I added these 
because some of the thing you may want to use callcc for could become 
complicated.  inline functions are a natural way to hide such complex 
things.

For an example of how these two features work together check out:

Other things?

Socket functions can now be told what interface to bind to.  There was a 
lot of code refactoring internally.  Also I added some more fault 
tolerance type functionality within the interpreter.  For 
example, functions clean up their stack frames properly in the event of failure

As usual the beta is available at: http://sleep.hick.org/

Enjoy the beta.
