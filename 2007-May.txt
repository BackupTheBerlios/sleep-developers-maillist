Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 Status and Release Roadmap
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0705202206220.29170@jethro.hick.org>

Hi guys,
I just wanted to take a minute and let everyone know what is happening
with Sleep 2.1.

I've been working hard on the new manual.  My goal is to have it replace
the current sleep reference within the next beta or two.  I've basically
told myself no coding until the new manual is able to stand as at least a
completed rough draft.  You can check out the in progress docs at

http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/

I synchronize my local copy of the new docs with the server after each
night of feverish work.  :)  Of course until this documentation is
ready, I will continue to keep the current Sleep reference up to date.

As I look at the issue tracker, I see enough work for about two more
betas.  As soon as the docs are good enough (~2 weeks) I'll start work on
the last two betas.

Beta 17 will hopefully be the Sleep 2.1 release candidate.  Once b17 is
ready I plan to do another jIRCii release, collect feedback from
scripters and other non-jIRCii Sleep users, fix the raised issues, and
release Sleep 2.1.

My goal date for the release of Sleep 2.1-stable will be 20 Jul 07.  Two
years from the release of Sleep 2.0-stable.

In the meantime, I hope everyone is enjoying the betas.  If there are any
questions or feedback feel free to hit me up via email.

Hi,
   
  I am struck up at a point wherein 
  1.  I want to read an environemt variable in my sleep script.
  2. Suppose I have read the evvironment variable somehow, I want to pass it to the exec command.
   
  for example
   
  $jbossPath = "/usr/local/jboss";
  exec(" $jbossPath/tasks/test.sl");
   
   I am getting a error overhere something like this
  java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1
        at java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1444)

1. Sleep 2.1 beta 10 released! (Raphael Mudge)

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hola,
Sleep 2.1-b10 has been released. This release contains a few feature
enhancements and several bug fixes.

Some of the items worth noting:

- I/O functions that read and print characters are unicode aware once
again. I originally made them non-unicode aware to ensure that mark,
skip, and reset on a handle all worked no matter what op you were using.
A little bit of hacking and now I have both. The function &setEncoding
was added to allow specifying which charset to interpret print/read ops
to the stream with.

- Added \x and \u literals for specifying 8 and 16 bit characters within
a parsed literal string.

- Added assignment operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, etc..
These also work with tuple assignment allowing some cool side effects,
i.e. to add the elements of two arrays together:
(@a) += @b;

- Fixed &consume so the code to hash/checksum a file is now fast and
simple :)

There is other stuff as well. A parser bug was fixed that prevented out
of context bareword tokens from being flagged as an error. One problem
this caused was scripters typing null in lieu of $null never received an
error.

Change log is available here:
http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html

Sleep can be downloaded at:
http://sleep.hick.org/download.html

I'm planning one more beta with a few new features. The next beta may be
a release candidate for Sleep 2.1. At the moment I am looking at my busy
life and the daunting task of finishing the new Sleep manual in a
reasonable amount of time. I may release without the new documentation.
Not sure yet.

Please enjoy the beta!

I would make sure you're not have an initial space in your exec command
i.e.

$handle = exec("$jbossPath $+ /tasks/test.sl"); # $+ is a concetenation op wi "strings"

The reason behind the space thing is if you pass a string as the first
parameter of exec, sleep will try to split it up into tokens using
whitespace as the delimeter.  The first token will be the command, the
second one the first argument, the third one the second argument, etc.  If
you want your arguments/paths to contain spaces then you can pass an array
as the first argument to exec() and it will use that as the source of the
tokens.

Usually it is also a good idea to assign the return value of exec to a
$handle so you can wait($handle) or closef($handle) if you choose to do
so later.  Not to mention you'd be able to read from it and things like
that as well. Use wait($handle) to wait for the process to complete as
exec is not a blocking call.

As for getting ahold of current environment variables, Java has a
deprecated method in the System class that may work for you...

$var = [System getenv: "PATH"]; # get the $ENV{PATH} var

seems to work for me...

[raffi at beardsley ~]$ java -jar sleep.jar -x '[System getenv: "PATH"]'
/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin

Now as for passing environment variables into exec.  This can be done as
well.  The in-progress reference has some information on the exec()
command:

http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/exec.html

i.e.:

%env    = %(FOO => "value", BAR => "bleh", PATH => "$path $+ ; $+ c:\\blah");
$handle = exec("$jbossPath $+ /tests/whatever.sl", %env);

I think that about answers your questions.  Good luck!
