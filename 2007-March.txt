Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 12 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0703111934300.26250@jethro.hick.org>

Hello everyone,
After a much needed hiatus, Sleep 2.1-b12 has been released.  This is a
good release with lots of stuff in it, I think you'll like it.  :)

1) Added the ability to include external files into the current script

This feature should make it easier to modularize scripts.  This was a pain
to implement as I had to make the compiled form of each script aware of
which file it came from.

2) String manipulation functions now normalize negative values

That is a fancy way of saying you can now do left("some string", -2) to
get all but the 2 left most characters in the specified string.  A little
bit of work was done to allow string manipulation functions to accept
negative chars.  In 2.1-b13 I'll work on applying this to array functions
as well.

3) Added byte buffers!

Scripters can now allocate a memory buffer with the allocate function and
manipulate it using Sleep's I/O functions.  This should help those of you
who need to generate and manipulate large amounts of data quickly.

4) Rewrote the interpreter and parser handling of parsed literals

I spent the majority of my day/night rewriting how Sleep parses and later
interprets parsed literals.  The code to do this before was incredibly
ugly.  So ugly that when I kept encountering odd bugs I decided to just
rewrite it and do it the right way.  So far I haven't noticed any
surprises but your mileage may vary.  Please keep me informed if anything
seemed to break in this area.

There is a bunch of other stuff in this release as well.  However the
above summarizes the highlights pretty well.

As usual, the change log is available here:
http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html

Sleep can be downloaded at:

Beta 13 will be coming within a week or two.  My aim in b13 is to allow
scripts to throw and catch exceptions, normalize negative values in array
manipulation functions, and fix some more bugs.  Hopefully after b13 we
will be feature complete for Sleep 2.1.  Once we reach that point I will
direct my efforts towards finishing the new Sleep manual.

As always, enjoy the beta!

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 13 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0703181124440.5143@jethro.hick.org>

Hello,
As you can see from the subject Sleep 2.1-b13 has been released.  I met
most of my goals for this beta but there is going to be at least a 2.1-b14
before I'm done adding stuff for this development cycle.

This release adds watch variables to Sleep's debugging arsenal.  Now
variables can be placed into a watch list and any updates to the container
referenced by that variable will be reported as a runtime warning (with
script/line number information).

This release also adds try/catch blocks as promised.  I opted to work
towards a delicate compromise between backwards compatability and having a
mechanism that works as expected.  The whatsnew.txt and the updated
documentation provide insight into what is happening here.  I'm happy with
how it turned out.  I think scripters requiring this will be as well.

This release also includes bug fixes, an &exit function, and probably
some other stuff.  Definitely check it out.

As always, enjoy the beta!

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 14 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0703241637590.19432@jethro.hick.org>

Hi everyone,
Finally, I believe we are feature complete for the 2.1 development cycle.
Sleep 2.1-b14 has been released today.  This release closes the last of
the features I was planning to add to Sleep 2.1.

The changes are small.  A few bug fixes and normalized index parameters
for array functions.

In conjunction with this release of Sleep, I've also released an update to
the Sleep-scriptable IRC client jIRCii.  jIRCii has a decent user base and
community of scripters.  I expect to use feedback from this release to put
any final polish on this Sleep release.

In the mean time I will be focusing on documentation.  I'm currently
working on the new Sleep 2.1 manual.  I expect we'll have the Sleep
2.1-stable release in roughly 1 month.

The change log is available here:

As always, enjoy the beta!
