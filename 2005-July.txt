Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.0 Released
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0507190608500.10881@jethro.hick.org>

Hello All,
Sleep 2.0 has offically been released.  This release is the culmination of
5 months of hardcore code hacking.   Sleep's old design goals consisted of
creating a language that was easily extensible and embedable into an
application.  Once these goals were accomplished Sleep 2.0 was conceived.
Sleep 2.0 took the simple Sleep language and brought it forward into a
powerful and full featured general purpose scripting language.

Major features in Sleep 2.0:
- Added the ability to create, access, and manipulate Java objects
  with the HOES subsystem.
- Added support for extracting and manipulating binary data.
- Added multidimensional data structures to the Sleep language.
- Added closures to the Sleep language.

Sleep 2.0 can be downloaded at: http://sleep.hick.org/

The release should be pretty stable.  I released a jIRCii beta with the
latest SVN dump 2 days ago.  No one has complained yet :)

Enjoy the release.
