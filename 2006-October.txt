Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 6 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.51.0610012235210.26631@rodan.syr.edu>

Hello,
Sleep 2.1b6 has been released.  This release completes the feature set I
was looking to add to Sleep 2.1.  My plan is to now focus on the new Sleep
documentation and to solicit feedback via a jIRCii release in the next few
weeks.  Once the documentation is complete (and maybe another beta or two,
consisting mostly of fixes) Sleep 2.1 will be final.

Highlights of Beta 6:
- Lots of work on coroutines.  Coroutines can now call themselves
  recursively and local variables are saved/restored as part of a
  coroutine's state.
- added setField(class/$object, "field", value) to set public/protected
  members of a class/object.
- added semaphores to the sleep language, this means forks can be
  synchronized.

Change log is available here:

As always Sleep can be downloaded at:
http://sleep.hick.org/download.html

Enjoy the beta!

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 7 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0610151947240.8840@jethro.hick.org>

Hello All,
Sleep 2.1b7 has been released.  The main cool feature of this release is
the ability to use the index operator on closures.  The index operator
allows retrieving and setting values in the this scope for the indexed
closure.

Andreas and I played around with this feature and attempted to build
something similar to ECMA script's prototype functions.  The test case
for this is in the Sleep distribution under tests/sleepoo.sl.

Change log is available here:

jIRCii-b40 was released last week as well.  This release of jIRCii
features Sleep 2.1-b6.  There have been over 1000 downloads of the latest
jIRCii beta so far (I know some software does much better... sue me :)).
The good news is no one has come after me with a big stick due to their
scripts being broken in the latest jIRCii beta.  This bodes well for
backwards compatability.  Some jIRCii users have as many as 10 scripts
loaded at any given time.  No news is definetly good news on this front.

As for the Sleep 2.1 release schedule, here is the plan to date.  I plan
to use the jIRCii community as Sleep beta testers.  While the jIRCii
community jumps on the latest version of Sleep I am working on a rewrite
of the Sleep documentation.  Once this documentation is somewhat usable
i'll post it to the Sleep website to solicit feedback.  Once the
complaints of the jIRCii community have been handled and the new manual is
complete, then I'll release Sleep 2.1-stable and call this a completed
development cycle.

As always, please enjoy the beta.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 8 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0610292055360.25146@jethro.hick.org>

Hello All,
Sleep 2.1-b8 has been released.  This release contains a few feature
enhancements and several bug fixes.

Some of the items worth noting:

- Functionality has been added to allow closures to share the "this" scope
  amongst eachother.  This has been added to &invoke and &lambda.  The
  main reason for all of this is to allow more experimentation with
  creating scaffolding for javascript style prototype functions.  I think
  we're there now.  Check out tests/sleepoo2.sl

- Many scripters sometimes forget to place a semicolon at the end of
  a statement assigning a closure to a scalar.  This of course creates
  all kinds of problems.   I added a check for a corrupted assignment
  stack that generates a runtime warning notifying the scripter of what
  happened.

- &exec was enhanced to allow specification of an environment and a
  starting directory.

There is other stuff as well. :)

Time for me to crash.  Enjoy the beta.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 Manual (alpha) posted
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0610302152460.240@jethro.hick.org>

Hello All,
As a sort of experiment I am posting the Sleep 2.1 Manual in its current
form to the Sleep homepage.

The new manual is a total rewrite of the current documentation.  The goal
is to provide a tutorial, a bridge writers guide, and a complete reference
all in one document.

Each page contains a feedback form that feeds right into the issue tracker
in case you want to get involved and help submit feedback.  (go easy on me
for a few weeks though... please :))

The new manual is available at:

http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/

Please feel free to check back often as I will be keeping the posted
documentation in sync with my local repository (thanks to a bunch of
scripts to automate the process).
