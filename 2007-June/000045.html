   This month's Presenters:

     Raphael Mudge - Sleep- an open-source scripting option for Java.
     This short presentation from the creator of Sleep demonstrates his
     embeddable scripting solution for Java applications. Sleep is
     heavily inspired by Perl with bits of Objective-C thrown in. The
     Sleep Java API allows the language to be extended with new
     constructs, operators, functions, and variable containers.

   AND

     Adam Myatt - Local Java Developer and Author has released a new
     book

     [2]Pro NetBeans IDE 5.5 Enterprise Edition
     - Discuss some favorite features about NetBeans 5.5 that he covered
     in the book
     - Talk about cool NetBeans stuff discussed at JavaOne
     - Talk about NetBeans 6 and the near future
     - Book giveaway/raffle

   We have many giveaways this month including a license of IntelliJ IDEA
   will be raffled off at the meeting.
