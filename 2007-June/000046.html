<PRE>Hi everyone,
Sleep 2.1-b17 has been released.  There are still a few very small items
in my todo list but from here on out I'll try to focus mostly on the
documentation.  The major changes in this release include:

* Fixed several bugs with try/catch.  Silly bugs shouldn't have been there
in the first place.  I highly recommend using debug(34) [throws all
errors] in larger projects.  try/catch is great for keeping error handling
under control

* Added a literal form for Java classes i.e. ^String resolves to
java.lang.String.class.  Also added an isa (think instanceof) predicate
and updated several functions to use literal class values.  Functions like
use can now accept a class literal or a String describing the class.
You're much better off using the class literal form as it is checked and
resolved at script compile time.  i.e.:

import jdbc.JDBCBridge from: JDBC.jar;
use(^JDBCBridge); # this is safe!

* assertions now accept an (optional) message parameter i.e.:
assert $x == 0 : &quot;hey, \$x is $x and not 0... it needs to be 0&quot;;

* Eliminated unnecessary calls to Class.forName in the Sleep script
parser.  Someone integrating Sleep into an applet project noticed that
this was creating lots of weird traffic back to their webserver.  This
problem has been fixed.

There are some other changes as well but this list covers the most
interesting ones.  Not bad for a single beta.  As always:

The change log is available here:
<A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html">http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html</A>

Sleep can be downloaded at:

Enjoy the beta, hopefully we'll have a release soon.
