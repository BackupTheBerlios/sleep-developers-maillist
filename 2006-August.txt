Hello All,

Change log is available here:

I've been sitting on this beta for about a month waiting to fix some I/O
problems. This release features a number of additions, stuff I think you
will like:

- added several functional programming style functions like search,
  reduce, and filter
- added a nice debug option to fire a runtime warning every time a bridge
  decides to flag an error (stuff that could be caught programatically
  with checkError())
- added some set type operations for @arrays like difference, union, and
  intersection
- added an assignment loop which is just an extended version of the whole
  loop.  i.e.:

  $handle = openf("somefile.txt");
  while $text (readln($handle))
  {
     println("Read: $text");
  }

- added numerous other little functions and small API enhancements.

Overall this is a big release with lots of fun changes.  Enjoy the beta.

I'm kind of tired so I am just going to paste the summary from the Sleep
homepage here.  Hopefully no one minds.

Added a 'strict' mode that warns scripters for failure to declare a
variable. Fixed an issue with scripts servicing multiple clients through
listening sockets. Updated several functions to accept an array or closure
as an argument (when a closure is specified, the bridge will iterate over
it until $null is returned). Added scripter access to setting and querying
the current debug level. Several other small bug fixes and enhancements.

Enjoy the beta.
