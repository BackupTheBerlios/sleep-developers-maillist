<PRE>Hello,
Sleep 2.1-b11 has been released.  This release is mainly bug fixes, I
didn't get a chance to work on many new features (as the fixes took
priority).

There is one new feature worth noting.  Sleep now features a built-in
profiler.  I'm working on a little web app at work and I wanted to
optimize performance a little.  To enable this type of functionality use
debug(8) to trace all function calls or debug(24) to enable profiling
without printing out every function call.  Use the built-in profile()
function to access the profiler statistics of the current script
environment.  There are also APIs within the ScriptInstance class for
accessing this information.

Most of the fixed bugs are related to ensuring Sleep reports the correct
line number when providing an error/warning message.  I did fix an issue
in the coroutines implementation.  Hopefully it is stable now.

Change log is available here:

Sleep can be downloaded at:
<A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/download.html">http://sleep.hick.org/download.html</A>

Beta 12 will contain some new features.  Notably the ability to include
another script and install a closure as an exception handler.  I was
aiming to have these things for this beta but bug fixes take precedence.

As always, enjoy the beta!
