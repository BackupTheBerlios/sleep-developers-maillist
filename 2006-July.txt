Hi guys,

The following code generates a parsing error:

 

$a = "asd";

$b = "fgh";

println("$a;$b");

 

saying:

 

YourCodeSucksException: 1 error(s): Unknown expression at 3

        at sleep.parser.Parser.parse(Unknown Source)

        at sleep.parser.Parser.parse(Unknown Source)

        at sleep.runtime.ScriptLoader.loadScript(Unknown Source)

        at sleep.runtime.ScriptLoader.loadScript(Unknown Source)

        at sleep.runtime.ScriptLoader.loadScript(Unknown Source)

 

Am I doing something wrong; I just want the two values separated by the ';'.

Cheers, Dani

Hi Dani,
Perl does some weird voodoo to replace variables inside of strings.
Instead of weird voodoo I put the work on the scripter because I am a
punk.  Inside of a string $+ does concatenation i.e.:

> println("$a $+ ; $+ $b");

The end result would be <value of $a>;<value of $b>

Hope that helped.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] custom function question
Message-ID: <002401c69e7b$a3565d30$ea031790$@com>

Hi everyone,

I am implementing some custom functions to export into a scripting
environment. I would like to catch any problems that might occur in those
functions of mine. Then I would like to report the problem so my
RuntimeWarningWatcher gets a ScriptWarning.  Is there any way of knowing the
script source line number where my function was executed?

Cheers, Dani

Hi Dani,
There are three options for communicating a error to a scripter.  Well
really two right now, but three if you feel like checking out the code
currently in the SVN repository.

Option 1:
Throw a RuntimeException or IllegalArgumentException.  These will bubble
up to the script interpreter and get turned into a nicely formatted
runtime exception.  Problem is they effectively cause a return on the
calling script so this mechanism is only useful for serious errors.

http://sleep.hick.org/sleepguide.html#2.95

Option 2:
Sleep has a built in function called checkError($error) that works a lot
like Perl's $!.  Basically when a non-fatal type error occurs $! is set to
a value describing the error.  In Sleep this $! value (not really $!)
anymore is available by calling checkError($error).  If checkError returns
1 then $error is set to the text of the error and the error is cleared.
Otherwise checkError returns 0.

http://sleep.hick.org/docs/api/sleep/runtime/ScriptEnvironment.html#flagError(java.lang.String)

This may be the option you're looking for.  As for the line numbers,
inside of the SVN repository (and part of Sleep 2.1 b2) there is a new
option to set a "debug" level for scripts.  If the debug level is set
properly any time an error is flagged in this way a runtime warning
exception will be reported with the appropriate script file and line
number.

One thing you will need to do to set this debug level in 2.1 b2:

ScriptInstance script; /* whare ever this comes from */

script.setDebugFlags(script.getDebugFlags() | ScriptInstance.DEBUG_SHOW_WARNINGS);

Option 3:
Finally as the last option there is something similar to flagError in
ScriptEnvironment sitting in the SVN that immediately fires a runtime
warning exception with the current line number/file attached to the
message you specify.   The function is showDebugMessage I believe.

That should about cover it.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] environment variable problem
Message-ID: <20060703142842.54328.qmail@web56206.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi,
  I am facing a problem.
  For example I have a environment varible JBOSS_HOME = /usr/local/jboss.
  In perl I can get the value of this variable in my script 
  $variable = $ENV{JBOSS_HOME}
   
  Is there some way in sleep script  through which we can get the values of environment variables ?
  Please advice

Java has a deprecated method for obtaining a variable from the
environment.  Specifically System.getenv("var name").

I haven't tested it but I assume the following would work:

$variable = [System getenv: "JBOSS_HOME"];
