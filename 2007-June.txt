Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 16 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0706102201230.8718@jethro.hick.org>

Hello,
Sleep 2.1-b16 has been released.  I just wanted to show that I am still
alive and working on the release.  :)  This release is mostly bug fixes.
I did add a new debug mode for tracing all predicates which should help
some of you.

>> Welcome to the Sleep scripting language
> interact
>> Welcome to interactive mode.
Type your code and then '.' on a line by itself to execute the code.
Type Ctrl+D or 'done' on a line by itself to leave interactive mode.
debug(64);
$var = iff("5" eq 5, "yes", "no");
.
Trace: '5' eq 5 ? TRUE at eval:1

The change log is available here:

Sleep can be downloaded at:

Enjoy the beta.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 17 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0706171557030.27919@jethro.hick.org>

Hi everyone,
Sleep 2.1-b17 has been released.  There are still a few very small items
in my todo list but from here on out I'll try to focus mostly on the
documentation.  The major changes in this release include:

* Fixed several bugs with try/catch.  Silly bugs shouldn't have been there
in the first place.  I highly recommend using debug(34) [throws all
errors] in larger projects.  try/catch is great for keeping error handling
under control

* Added a literal form for Java classes i.e. ^String resolves to
java.lang.String.class.  Also added an isa (think instanceof) predicate
and updated several functions to use literal class values.  Functions like
use can now accept a class literal or a String describing the class.
You're much better off using the class literal form as it is checked and
resolved at script compile time.  i.e.:

import jdbc.JDBCBridge from: JDBC.jar;
use(^JDBCBridge); # this is safe!

* assertions now accept an (optional) message parameter i.e.:
assert $x == 0 : "hey, \$x is $x and not 0... it needs to be 0";

* Eliminated unnecessary calls to Class.forName in the Sleep script
parser.  Someone integrating Sleep into an applet project noticed that
this was creating lots of weird traffic back to their webserver.  This
problem has been fixed.

There are some other changes as well but this list covers the most
interesting ones.  Not bad for a single beta.  As always:

The change log is available here:
http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html

Sleep can be downloaded at:

Enjoy the beta, hopefully we'll have a release soon.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] sleep aware editor
Message-ID: <494669.48948.qm@web62307.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I just started using sleep again after being away for a while and am wondering what sleep aware editors there are available.  Unless I am dreaming (ha!) I noticed vim had some syntax highlighting, but I'd like to use something like jedit or anything else, really.

Why did I start using sleep again?  I need to do some scripting (put messages on MQSeries queues) on OS/400.  Jruby barfs with incompatibilities and is way to heavy for that system (its old).  sleep has great documentation, is small and fast, and importing java classes is a snap.  Maybe it is also with rhino but darn if I had to look high and low for any answer for 3rd party jars but never found anything.  Plus I still have a soft spot for perl =).

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric,
Welcome back to Sleep.  There are no Sleep specific IDE options at this
time.  If you're looking for basic syntax highlighting use the perl
settings for your editor and you should be set.

I heard the new netbeans makes it easier to add support for scripting
languages but I haven't looked at it.  Since IDEs are not really my thing
this is an open issue anyone is welcome to address.

Any volunteers? :)

Subject: [Sleep-developers] updating a bean class in java through a sleep
	script
Message-ID: <844580.41122.qm@web57702.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi,
   
  I am struck up at a point wherein I want to update a bean class through my sleep script.
  First of all is it possible to update a bean class through a sleep script?
   
  Supppose I have a java class Person.java
   
  public class Person {
      String name;
      int age;
   
      public String getName(){
             return name;
      }
   
      public int getAge(){
           return age;
      }
   
     public void setName(String name){
            this.name = name;
     }
   
     public void setAge(int age){
           this.age = age;
     }
   
  }
   
  Now I have a sleep script through which I want to initialize a object of this class.
  I am not sure how to go for this.
  Please suggest.
  Thanx in advance

Hi there.  This isn't too bad to do.  Sleep supports interacting with Java
classes quite well.

First off you'll want to import the package containing your class.  The
syntax to do this is the same as Java.

import java.util.*; # as an example.

or

import stuff.people.Person from: mystuff.jar; # import from a jar

To instantiate your class:

$person = [new Person];
[$person setName: "SHASHIDHAR MISRA"];
println("Name is: " . [$person getName]);

To update a public field use the setField function.  General format for
using Java objects from Sleep is:

[$object methodName: arg1, arg2, ...];

More on this concept at: http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/hoes.html

Hope this helps.
