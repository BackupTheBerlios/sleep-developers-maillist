Hello,
It has been quiet on the Sleep front lately.  Recently I had a hard
drive crash that cost me my in progress Sleep 2.1 todo list.  Needless to
say this has delayed start up work on Sleep 2.1.

To get things back on their feet I've adopted the issue tracking system
used by jIRCii onto the Sleep website.

You can now post bug reports/feature requests, edit old reports, and
comment on open reports.  the system has worked out well for jIRCii so
far, hopefully it can do the same for the Sleep world.

The URL to the system is:
http://jircii.hick.org/cgi-bin/sleep/bitch.cgi/

Feel free to check it out.
