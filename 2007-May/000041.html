<PRE>Hi guys,
I just wanted to take a minute and let everyone know what is happening
with Sleep 2.1.

I've been working hard on the new manual.  My goal is to have it replace
the current sleep reference within the next beta or two.  I've basically
told myself no coding until the new manual is able to stand as at least a
completed rough draft.  You can check out the in progress docs at

<A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/">http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/</A>

I synchronize my local copy of the new docs with the server after each
night of feverish work.  :)  Of course until this documentation is
ready, I will continue to keep the current Sleep reference up to date.

As I look at the issue tracker, I see enough work for about two more
betas.  As soon as the docs are good enough (~2 weeks) I'll start work on
the last two betas.

Beta 17 will hopefully be the Sleep 2.1 release candidate.  Once b17 is
ready I plan to do another jIRCii release, collect feedback from
scripters and other non-jIRCii Sleep users, fix the raised issues, and
release Sleep 2.1.

My goal date for the release of Sleep 2.1-stable will be 20 Jul 07.  Two
years from the release of Sleep 2.0-stable.

In the meantime, I hope everyone is enjoying the betas.  If there are any
questions or feedback feel free to hit me up via email.

-- Raphael
