Subject: [Sleep-developers] Slumber 1.0-b1 released!
Message-ID: <480F0B9B.2050204@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Hot on the heels of the new Sleep release, here's a brand new version of 
Slumber that works with the latest Sleep beta. Get it here: 
http://code.google.com/p/slumber/

Changes include:
 * Default sql data type is now java.sql.BINARY instead of 
java.lang.Object, which should ensure better compatability across 
various database systems
 * Fixed a bug where row data was converted to strings
 * Fixed a problem with the RowScalarHash, cloning did not work as intended
 * Added more tests
 * Updated the readme

Detailed list of changes with diffs here:

-Andreas
