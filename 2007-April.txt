Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 15 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0704251932340.26043@jethro.hick.org>

Hello everyone,
I'm experiencing a little bit of end of term crunch.  Hence the delayed
beta.  Sleep 2.1-b15 is now out.  This release is mostly bug fixes.
Particuarly with how Sleep handles converting scalar arrays to Java
arrays.  I also added an assert command.

Still a few open bugs/issues to look at.  That aside, this development
cycle is almost complete.

The change log is available here:

Sleep can be downloaded at:

As always, enjoy the beta!
