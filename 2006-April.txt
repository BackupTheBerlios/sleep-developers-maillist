Subject: [Sleep-developers] How to get a hash from sleep script to Java HashMap
Message-ID: <849535E338E99741B7F7413F73253EDB03A84FCA@us-nj-mail1.comverse.com>

Hi Raphael


   We are planning on using Sleep in our project. I would like to know
if there is a good way to pass a nested data structure from a sleep
script to Java.

   %root["template"] = "aparna";
   %root["dataname"] = "result";
    %root["result"] = @arrayOfHashes; 

How can I access %root from Java Application?

 Scalar testvar  =  script.getScriptVariables().getScalar("%root"); 

Is there a way to convert/cast testvar to a HashMap? Also can we convert
an array to an ArrayList?

Regards,
Aparna

Hi Aparna,
You are on the right track as far as obtaining the %root
sleep.runtime.Scalar object.

What you may be looking for is a routine like the following:

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import sleep.runtime.Scalar;

public static HashMap toHashMap(Scalar value)
{
   HashMap temp = new HashMap();

   Iterator i = value.getHash().keys().scalarIterator();
   while (i.hasNext())
   {
      Scalar key = (Scalar)i.next();

      /* note: default Sleep hash implementation stores all keys as strings */
      temp.put(key.objectValue(), value.getHash().getAt(key).objectValue());
   }

   return temp;
}

Hope this helps (I haven't ran/tested the above code but it should work).
Also be sure to check out the API docs for Sleep at:
http://sleep.hick.org/docs/api/

The array conversion is a little more straight forward, just initialize
your favorite container and use getArray() on a scalar and loop through it
with the scalar iterator bit as above.

Sleep might benefit from an API to do this eh?

Good luck.
