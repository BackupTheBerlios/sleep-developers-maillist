Subject: [Sleep-developers] exit status of a command through sleep script
Message-ID: <20060601093708.22981.qmail@web53302.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
  I have  just started using the sleep scripting.I need to know that is there some way through which I can get the exit value of a command through the sleep script.
   
  for e.g I wrote a script which contains

$process = exec("ls -al");  @data = readAll($process);  closef($process);

here @data contains the output of ls -al.Now i also want to know the exit valuue of the command "ls -al".

Is there some way in sleep script through which I can get this?

please suggest something.

Hello,
At the moment using exec() there isn't a way to retrieve the exit value of
a process.  I've filed an RFE to add this feature.

http://jircii.hick.org/cgi-bin/sleep/bitch.cgi/view.html?6296495

To get this type of functionality in the meantime you would have to use
HOES to instiate a java.io.Process object i.e.:

$proc = [[Runtime getRuntime] exec: "ls -al"];

To get the return value of this $proc you could use:
println("Return value: " . [$proc exitValue]);

Now if you wanted to use the sleep I/O functions on this process you would
have to wire up the I/O yourself...

import sleep.bridges.io.IOObject;

$handle = [new IOObject];
[$handle openRead: [$proc getInputStream]];
[$handle openWrite: [$proc getOutputStream]];

Then you could use read, readln, readAll etc.. on $handle.  closef wuld
only close the streams though and not kill the process.

Hope this helps.

Hi Dani,
I reworked your code a little bit and double checked what it would take to
reference the constant you're looking for below:

import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;
import java.util.Properties;

$props = [new Properties];
$session = [Session getDefaultInstance : $props, $null];
$m = [new MimeMessage: $session];
[$m addRecipient: [Message$RecipientType TO],
                  [new InternetAddress:"test at test.com"]];
[$m setText: "test"];

I don't know why the Java Mail API designer opted to define a bunch of
static constants inside of a static inner class but the way you address a
static inner class via Java reflection is using Classname$InnerClassname.
The . character is used to specify a class within a certain package.
Hopefully this helps.

P.S. sorry about the slow reply, been kind of bogged down lately.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] hasmatch problem?
Message-ID: <200606022320.k52NKorQ029869@smtp.hispeed.ch>

Hi guys, 

Trying to use regular expressions within a multithreaded environment like
that:

 

$my_th = {

 

 $ctime = [java.lang.System currentTimeMillis];

 $mystr = "[" . $ctime . "] AAA BBBAAA AAA";

 println("mystr = " . $mystr);

 if($mystr hasmatch '\[(\d+)\].+') {

  println("M : " . matched()[0]);

 }

};

 

 

while($ii < 10) {

 $ii = $ii + 1;

 fork($my_th,$iter => "$ii");

}

 

All lines should be matched in my opinion but I get only 5 or 6. Could it be
a threading problem or maybe problem is totally somewhere else?

Cheers, Dani

You get the prize, this is definetly a threading issue.  My own fault but
something I can fix.  Basically when you use hasmatch it saves the
regex results into an instance variable inside of the regex bridge.
matched() then references this instance variable.  This was a failure to
mantain that isolation of script environments that I've been mostly good
about.  I'll file a bug on this and fix it in Sleep 2.1 (as soon as I
either implement or give up on implementing coroutines a beta will be
forth coming).

I will also put a note about this implementation mistake into the sleep
bridge developers guide, most of the time if I need to track an instance
of something I do it in a script environment (this allows the bridge to be
thread safe as only one block of code can be executing in any thread per
script environment at any time thanks to internal synchronization built
into sleep, this is why fork() spins off a new script environment hidden
from the parent one).

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 1 released
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0606151955590.7011@jethro.hick.org>

Hello All,
Sleep 2.1b1 has been released.  This represents the start of the 2.1
development cycle.

Change log is available here:
http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html

As always Sleep can be downloaded at:
http://sleep.hick.org/download.html

The major new feature in this release is coroutines.  I did a lot of work
on the interpreter to support this feature effectively.  So far no
problems have shown up in my tests but these changes have yet to be tested
by a wide audience.

Enjoy the beta.
