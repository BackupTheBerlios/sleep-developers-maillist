Hi Raphel,
   
  Thanks for the reply
   
  I am trying this approach but I am getting some CLASSPATH error
   
  I am executing a sleep script which contains following
   
  import org.com.test from: common-jars.jar;
   
  $person= [new Person];
  [$person setName: "shashi" ];
  println("Name is: " . [$person getName]);
   
  Now I am executing my sleep script by passing the CLASSPATH from the command prompt
   
  java -Dsleep.classpath=/usr/local/jboss/test  -jar sleep.jar test.sl
   
  I am getting  a ClassNotFound error.
  I have checked that my common-jars.jar contains my Person.class and the jar is kept at the location /usr/local/jboss/test .
   
  I this correct what I am doing or there is something else which I am missing?
  Please suggest.

Hi there. This isn't too bad to do. Sleep supports interacting with Java
classes quite well.

First off you'll want to import the package containing your class. The
syntax to do this is the same as Java.

import java.util.*; # as an example.

or

import stuff.people.Person from: mystuff.jar; # import from a jar

To instantiate your class:

$person = [new Person];
[$person setName: "SHASHIDHAR MISRA"];
println("Name is: " . [$person getName]);

To update a public field use the setField function. General format for
using Java objects from Sleep is:

[$object methodName: arg1, arg2, ...];

Hope this helps.

Hi,
   
  The CLASSPATH error was probably because of the sleep version. Previously I was using version 2.0  but once I changed my version to 2.1 the CLASSPATH error was resolved.
  Thanx for all the suggestions.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] setting the system property sleep.classpath from
	the java code
In-Reply-To: <mailman.107.1183456921.4499.sleep-developers@lists.berlios.de>
Message-ID: <736915.40787.qm@web57713.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi,
   
  I have a problem  as how to pass the system property sleep.classpath from the java code.
   
  I have a sleep script which I want to run by passing the system property sleep.classpath.
  I want my script to locate a jar depending upon the value of sleep.classpath.
  When I am running my sleep script from the command prompt such as
   
  java -Dsleep.classpath=/usr/local/jboss/server/default/deploy/deploy.last/TestService.sar -jar /usr/local/jboss/server/default/lib/sleep.jar test.sl
   
  It's getting the variable sleep.classpath and it's running fine.
   
  However when I am running the sleep script from my java code such as
   
  String function = "execute";
  ScriptLoader loader = new ScriptLoader();
  loader.addSpecificBridge(new SetupBridge());
  ScriptInstance scriptLoad = loader.loadScript(sleepScript);
  scriptLoad.runScript();
  Scalar output = scriptLoad.callFunction("&"+function, new Stack());
   
  It's not getting the variable sleep.classpath .
  As it is throwing the following error
  Is there some way through which I can pass the variable sleep.classpath from the java code.
  How does the runScript method executes a sleep script?
  Please suggest if anyone has any clues. I am not sure as how to go for this.
  Thanx in advance.

I have checked that my common-jars.jar contains my Person.class and the jar is kept at the location /usr/local/jboss/test .

I this correct what I am doing or there is something else which I am missing?
Please suggest.

Hi,

The CLASSPATH error was probably because of the sleep version. Previously I was using version 2.0 but once I changed my version to 2.1 the CLASSPATH error was resolved.
Thanx for all the suggestions.

Hi Raphel,

Thanks for the reply

I am trying this approach but I am getting some CLASSPATH error

I am executing a sleep script which contains following

import org.com.test from: common-jars.jar;

$person= [new Person];
[$person setName: "shashi" ];
println("Name is: " . [$person getName]);

Now I am executing my sleep script by passing the CLASSPATH from the command prompt

java -Dsleep.classpath=/usr/local/jboss/test -jar sleep.jar test.sl

I am getting a ClassNotFound error.
I have checked that my common-jars.jar contains my Person.class and the jar is kept at the location /usr/local/jboss/test .

I this correct what I am doing or there is something else which I am missing?
Please suggest.

Hi there. This isn't too bad to do. Sleep supports interacting with Java
classes quite well.

First off you'll want to import the package containing your class. The
syntax to do this is the same as Java.

import java.util.*; # as an example.

or

import stuff.people.Person from: mystuff.jar; # import from a jar

To instantiate your class:

$person = [new Person];
[$person setName: "SHASHIDHAR MISRA"];
println("Name is: " . [$person getName]);

To update a public field use the setField function. General format for
using Java objects from Sleep is:

[$object methodName: arg1, arg2, ...];

More on this concept at: http://sleep.hick.org/docs/manual/hoes.html

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] setting the system property sleep.classpath
 from the java code
In-Reply-To: <736915.40787.qm@web57713.mail.re3.yahoo.com>
References: <736915.40787.qm@web57713.mail.re3.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0707040944560.10127@jethro.hick.org>

Hi Shashidhar,
There is a static Java method to set and query the Sleep classpath value
in sleep.parser.ParserConfig.

http://sleep.hick.org/docs/api/sleep/parser/ParserConfig.html

ParserConfig.setSleepClasspath("/usr/local/jboss/server/default/deploy/deploy.last/TestService.sar");

This method should be called before you parse/compile a script (so before
loader.loadScript).

runScript literally takes the compiled and ready to run script and starts
executing it.  Nothing more to it than that.

Here is the code Sleep uses to hunt for a jar file (located in
ParserConfig.java):

   /** Search the sleep classpath for the specified file.  Returns a File object reflecting where the
       file was found.  This method does not return null.  If the file does not exist then a File object
       constructed with just the passed in name is returned */
   public static File findJarFile(String name)
   {
       File cp = new File(name);

       if (cp.exists()) { return cp; }

       String[] paths = System.getProperty("sleep.classpath", ".").split(";");

       for (int x = 0; x < paths.length; x++)
       {
          File temp = new File(paths[x], name);
          if (temp.exists())
          {
             return temp;
          }
       }

       return cp;
   }

Hopefully that helps you out.  I'm getting ready to start rebuilding the
Sleep Developer's Guide (for extending/embedding Sleep).  Questions like
this are valuable to me as it will ensure I don't let these types of
details slip through the cracks.

Good luck.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 18 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0707042244280.4140@jethro.hick.org>

Hi everyone,
Sleep 2.1-b18 has been released.  This release is a mixed bag of things:

* Added scalar references i.e. \$x as a shortcut for $x => $x.  key/value
  pairs are often used to move variables between scopes and this sugar
  merely helps to facilitate such things.

* Added backtick operator to spawn an external program (ala Perl):
  @files = `ls -alh`;

* Updated Java method resolution to better handle char[] and byte[] types

* More verbose error messages for class/package import

* Updated set functions removeAll, retainAll, and addAll to use scalar
  "identity" rather than string values for determining equivalence.

The change log is available here:
http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html

Sleep can be downloaded at:
http://sleep.hick.org/download.html

Enjoy the beta.

Hi!

I'm posting this here ahead of release to get some fresh eyes on the 
code. On the todo list is the following:
 * More error/exception handling
 * Writing and running unit tests for prepared statements

Basically the only news here since the first version are the prepared 
statements.

Attached is JDBC.java and a README for quick reference.

You're adding prepared statements!!! I have a friend of mine who will love
you forever.

As a quick aside, I updated your .zip file on the sleep site to include an
ant build file and slight updates to your example instructions.

Namely use() has been updated a little bit.  The old form of taking a
string still works.  However one can now do:

import no.printf.whatever.JDBCBridge from: JDBC.jar;

use(^JDBCBridge);

With this form scripters benefit from compile time checking of the
reachability/existence of the class. (^Something is the Sleep equivalent
of Something.class in Java).

Good to see you're alive.

Is it possible to set up a REPL for Sleep?

Two options for this.  Both are within the Sleep console.   Sleep has a
simple expression evaluator and an interact mode that both work like an
REPL.  I made the mistake of separating statements from expressions when
conceptualizing the language.  I didn't know any better so we're kind of
stuck with it.

Type your code and then '.' on a line by itself to execute the code.
Type Ctrl+D or 'done' on a line by itself to leave interactive mode.
println("Hello World");
.
Hello World
$x = 45 * 10;
.
$closure = let({ println("Value is: $x"); }, \$x);
.
[$closure];
.
Value is: 450

Hm out of curiousity, expressions and statements are separate how? There 
is no relation between them? Hmm, maybe something to put on the todo for 
Sleep 3.0? :)

As for the REPL, I think interactive mode will do fine for my needs. 
Thanks for the tip!

Hi all,
hick.org experienced a bit of a hard drive crash.  I don't know if they'll
be able to recover all of the files or not.  In the meantime
sleep.hick.org and jircii.hick.org are down.

I'm going to be on travel for the next few days.  I will try to get the
sites back online as soon as possible.

Hi Andreas,

 

I am the friend of Raph's that has been using your JDBC Bridge.  It has
worked wonderfully for me.  The only issue that I have had is being able
to write blobs to a database.  I attempted to use HOES and the Java API
but messed that up somehow.  I was not able to properly retrieve the
data that I had hopefully inserted (at least I was not able to pull data
from the inserted records).  I have a HUGE data structure that my
program maintains (data does not fit in 3.5 Gig) and need to clean out,
but I need to save the records I delete and would like to save it in a
database as a blob.  Have you done anything like that?  If so a small
sample would be appreciated to see what I messed up).  Have a GREAT day!

 

Marty.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Slumber 1.0 alpha release (Was: Developer
	preview: JDBC bridge 1.0)
Message-ID: <46AD09E7.1040906@gmail.com>

I'm glad to announce an alpha release of Slumber, a set of useful 
extensions for Sleep. So far it consists of a JDBC bridge, as well as a 
bridge for text various text operations. The biggest news here is the 
support for prepared statements, which are strongly encouraged for 
queries involving user input to avoid direct or indirect SQL injections.

The JDBC bridge is fully backwards compatible -- however, existing users 
will need to change their use() line slightly to be able to load the 
bridges. Refer to the README and examples for more information.

Slumber 1.0-alpha is available for download here: 
http://printf.no/slumber/Slumber-1.0-alpha.zip

Slumber 1.0 alpha requires Java SE 1.5, and has been tested with the 
current Sleep 2.1 b18 release. A beta release of Slumber will be made 
within the next few weeks.
