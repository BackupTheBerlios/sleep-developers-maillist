Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 4 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.51.0609102311170.391@rodan.syr.edu>

Hello,
Sleep 2.1b4 has been released.  It has been nearly 3 weeks and I feel
enough has been accomplished to warrant a new beta release.

Some of the exciting new things:

1. import has been extended to allow classes to be loaded from 3rd party
jars i.e.:

debug(7);
global('$builder $document $output');

import org.jdom.*        from: jdom.jar;
import org.jdom.input.*  from: jdom.jar;
import org.jdom.output.* from: jdom.jar;

$builder  = [new SAXBuilder];
$document = [$builder build: "begin.xml"];

$output   = [new XMLOutputter: [Format getPrettyFormat]];
[$output output: $document, [System out]];

The script snippet above uses the JDOM API to load an XML document and
print it back out.  This inability to easily load 3rd party Jars not part
of the current classpath was one of the motivations for starting work on
Sleep 2.1.  I'm happy this feature is finally present.

2. A new debug option: trace function calls!

A new debug flag has been added to trace all function calls for a given
script.  If the debug value on the script above is changed to 15, the
trace output would look like:

Trace: &global('$builder $document $output') at line 2
Trace: [new org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder] = org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder at db484d at line 8
Trace: [org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder at db484d build: 'begin.xml'] = [Document: No DOCTYPE declaration, Root is [Element: <environment/>]] at line 9
Trace: [org.jdom.output.Format getPrettyFormat] = org.jdom.output.Format at cade31 at line 11
Trace: [new org.jdom.output.XMLOutputter: org.jdom.output.Format at cade31] = XMLOutputter[omitDeclaration = false, encoding = UTF-8, omitEncoding = false, indent = '  ', expandEmptyElements = false, lineSeparator = '\r\n', textMode = TRIM] at line 11
Trace: [XMLOutputter[omitDeclaration = false, encoding = UTF-8, omitEncoding = false, indent = '  ', expandEmptyElements = false, lineSeparator = '\r\n', textMode = TRIM] output: [Document:  No DOCTYPE declaration, Root is [Element: <environment/>]], java.io.PrintStream at bdc9b3] at line 12

3. New literal form for arrays and hashes

This beta also includes a new more terse literal form for creating arrays
and hashes i.e.:

@array = @("a", "b", @("c1", "c2", "c3"), "d", "e");
%hash  = %(a => "alpha", b => "bravo", c => "charlie", d => "delta");

Change log is available here:

There are several other changes and fixes as well.  As usual enjoy the
beta.

Subject: [Sleep-developers] Sleep 2.1 beta 5 released!
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.51.0609171830220.12479@rodan.syr.edu>

Hello,
Sleep 2.1b5 has been released.  This release is more of a bug fix release
with a few new features.

New features are:
- added functions to checksum and digest I/O handles or byte data.
- rewrote the Sleep->Java method/constructor resolution.  results should
  be a lot more accurate
- added a casti function to cast a sleep scalar into various java
  primitives (for the sake of passing to a Java method iff sleep's
  automatic conversion is failing you somehow)
- pack/unpack can now pack and unpack binary data to/from characters
  representing their hex value with the new 'h/H' template character.

- stdin/stdout console is now identified to scripts via the %console%
  variable (installed into the script environment hashtable).  the console
  is a sleep.bridges.io.IOObject set to System.in and System.out by
  default.  the good news is now in your application integration you can
  change this behavior if you so desire.
