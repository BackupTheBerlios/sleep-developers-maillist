<PRE>Hi Maurice,
Sleep does not provide an API to do this per se, however if you run a
script in its own java.lang.Thread you can use the stop, resume, and pause
methods there (I assume).  I should warn you though that these methods are
deprecated as they are prone to cause deadlock.

Scripts can also voluntarily relinquish control using the yield statement
(works like return).  When yield is called within a function, the state of
the function is saved, and the yielded value is returned.  The next time
the function is called execution resumes from where yield was last called.

Can you provide any more information about what your application is doing
and what the need is for the halt, pause, and resume of threads?  Maybe
there is another way to go about this.
