<PRE>Hola,
Sleep 2.1-b10 has been released.  This release contains a few feature
enhancements and several bug fixes.

Some of the items worth noting:

- I/O functions that read and print characters are unicode aware once
  again.  I originally made them non-unicode aware to ensure that mark,
  skip, and reset on a handle all worked no matter what op you were using.
  A little bit of hacking and now I have both.  The function &amp;setEncoding
  was added to allow specifying which charset to interpret print/read ops
  to the stream with.

- Added \x and \u literals for specifying 8 and 16 bit characters within
  a parsed literal string.

- Added assignment operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, etc..
  These also work with tuple assignment allowing some cool side effects,
  i.e. to add the elements of two arrays together:
  (@a) += @b;

- Fixed &amp;consume so the code to hash/checksum a file is now fast and
  simple :)

There is other stuff as well.  A parser bug was fixed that prevented out
of context bareword tokens from being flagged as an error.  One problem
this caused was scripters typing null in lieu of $null never received an
error.

Change log is available here:

Sleep can be downloaded at:

I'm planning one more beta with a few new features.  The next beta may be
a release candidate for Sleep 2.1.  At the moment I am looking at my busy
life and the daunting task of finishing the new Sleep manual in a
reasonable amount of time.  I may release without the new documentation.
Not sure yet.

Please enjoy the beta!
