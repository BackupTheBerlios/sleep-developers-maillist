<PRE>Hello All,
Sleep 2.1b7 has been released.  The main cool feature of this release is
the ability to use the index operator on closures.  The index operator
allows retrieving and setting values in the this scope for the indexed
closure.

Andreas and I played around with this feature and attempted to build
something similar to ECMA script's prototype functions.  The test case
for this is in the Sleep distribution under tests/sleepoo.sl.

Change log is available here:
<A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html">http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html</A>

Sleep can be downloaded at:
<A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/download.html">http://sleep.hick.org/download.html</A>

jIRCii-b40 was released last week as well.  This release of jIRCii
features Sleep 2.1-b6.  There have been over 1000 downloads of the latest
jIRCii beta so far (I know some software does much better... sue me :)).
The good news is no one has come after me with a big stick due to their
scripts being broken in the latest jIRCii beta.  This bodes well for
backwards compatability.  Some jIRCii users have as many as 10 scripts
loaded at any given time.  No news is definetly good news on this front.

As for the Sleep 2.1 release schedule, here is the plan to date.  I plan
to use the jIRCii community as Sleep beta testers.  While the jIRCii
community jumps on the latest version of Sleep I am working on a rewrite
of the Sleep documentation.  Once this documentation is somewhat usable
i'll post it to the Sleep website to solicit feedback.  Once the
complaints of the jIRCii community have been handled and the new manual is
complete, then I'll release Sleep 2.1-stable and call this a completed
development cycle.

As always, please enjoy the beta.

-- Raphael
