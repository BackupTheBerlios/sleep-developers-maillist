<PRE>Hi guys,
I'm on a bit of a fact finding mission at this time.  Sleep 2.1 is nearly 
ready for release.  Quite a bit of work to do on the documentation but I 
am addressing that.

In the meantime, I have some questions about you.  If you want to help 
Sleep out, reply to this email answering one or all of these questions:

1. What do you use Sleep for?
2. What do you like about it?
3. If you were hacking on Sleep, what would you do to improve it?

Thats it.  I'll keep any replies I receive confidential.  To protect this 
confidentiality, you'll want to reply to me directly (double check 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sleep-developers">sleep-developers at lists.berlios.de</A> is not in the To field).

My goal with this fact finding is just to better understand how you're 
using Sleep.  This will help with future articles, focused documentation, 
and better content for the website.

--Raphael

(p.s. I'm open to public statements about your experience with Sleep but 
before anything from you would ever go public I'll explicitly coordinate 
with you what will be posted.  Feel free to indicate if you're interested 
in providing such a statement.  I'll contact you about it)
