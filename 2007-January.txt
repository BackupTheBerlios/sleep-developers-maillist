Subject: [Sleep-developers] Newbie question: termination of a script
Message-ID: <b6077b530701251400x29aa083cl6e1facdb6d925ab9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello
Probably a stupid question but here goes.

The documentation does not seem to describe an exit() builtin - that is, a
statement that causes script.runScript() to return. I deduce (from
experiment) that a return statement at the outer level has this effect (and
presumably that is equivalent to falling off the end of the script).

The question is: is there some way for the code within a subroutine (or
closure) to invoke such an exit?

The motivation for asking this is that I am trying to construct a script of
this form:

get a key;
if key == exitKey then return 0;

do something(1) based on key;

get a key;
if key == exitKey then return 0;

do something(2) based on key;

etc...

and I'd like to wrap it like this (a sequence of steps):

$key = getAKey();
doSomething(1,$key);
$key = getAKey();
doSomething(2,$key);
etc...

where
sub getAKey {
  $key = readKey();
  if($key == $exitKey)
  {
     exit();
  }
  return $key;
}


Regards
Tim
