Subject: [Sleep-developers] opinions/thoughts on moving mailing list

Hello everyone,
berlios.de (which provides hosting of Sleep SVN among other things) seems
to suffer from a lack of maintenance.  There is no response to support
requests and the certificate for lists.berlios.de has been hosed for
awhile now.  With this in mind I'm interested in moving the Sleep mailing
list.

1. Are there any suggestions for a good free mailing list host?

2. Would there be any objections to a google group to take the place of a
mailing list?

Your thoughts are appreciated.
