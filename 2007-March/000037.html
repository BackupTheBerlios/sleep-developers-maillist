<PRE>Hello everyone,
After a much needed hiatus, Sleep 2.1-b12 has been released.  This is a
good release with lots of stuff in it, I think you'll like it.  :)

1) Added the ability to include external files into the current script

This feature should make it easier to modularize scripts.  This was a pain
to implement as I had to make the compiled form of each script aware of
which file it came from.

2) String manipulation functions now normalize negative values

That is a fancy way of saying you can now do left(&quot;some string&quot;, -2) to
get all but the 2 left most characters in the specified string.  A little
bit of work was done to allow string manipulation functions to accept
negative chars.  In 2.1-b13 I'll work on applying this to array functions
as well.

3) Added byte buffers!

Scripters can now allocate a memory buffer with the allocate function and
manipulate it using Sleep's I/O functions.  This should help those of you
who need to generate and manipulate large amounts of data quickly.

4) Rewrote the interpreter and parser handling of parsed literals

I spent the majority of my day/night rewriting how Sleep parses and later
interprets parsed literals.  The code to do this before was incredibly
ugly.  So ugly that when I kept encountering odd bugs I decided to just
rewrite it and do it the right way.  So far I haven't noticed any
surprises but your mileage may vary.  Please keep me informed if anything
seemed to break in this area.

There is a bunch of other stuff in this release as well.  However the
above summarizes the highlights pretty well.

As usual, the change log is available here:

Sleep can be downloaded at:
<A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/download.html">http://sleep.hick.org/download.html</A>

Beta 13 will be coming within a week or two.  My aim in b13 is to allow
scripts to throw and catch exceptions, normalize negative values in array
manipulation functions, and fix some more bugs.  Hopefully after b13 we
will be feature complete for Sleep 2.1.  Once we reach that point I will
direct my efforts towards finishing the new Sleep manual.

As always, enjoy the beta!
