<PRE>Hello,
As you can see from the subject Sleep 2.1-b13 has been released.  I met
most of my goals for this beta but there is going to be at least a 2.1-b14
before I'm done adding stuff for this development cycle.

This release adds watch variables to Sleep's debugging arsenal.  Now
variables can be placed into a watch list and any updates to the container
referenced by that variable will be reported as a runtime warning (with
script/line number information).

This release also adds try/catch blocks as promised.  I opted to work
towards a delicate compromise between backwards compatability and having a
mechanism that works as expected.  The whatsnew.txt and the updated
documentation provide insight into what is happening here.  I'm happy with
how it turned out.  I think scripters requiring this will be as well.

This release also includes bug fixes, an &amp;exit function, and probably
some other stuff.  Definitely check it out.

The change log is available here:

Sleep can be downloaded at:

As always, enjoy the beta!
